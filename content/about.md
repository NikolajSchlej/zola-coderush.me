# #whoami
_Hello, world!_ After writing a decent amount of texts on UEFI development and reverse engineering [in Russian](https://habr.com/ru/users/CodeRush/articles/) it's finally time for me to start writing in English, both for improving my language skills and for reaching a broader audience.

I'm **Nikolaj Schlej** aka **CodeRush**, author of [UEFITool](https://github.com/LongSoft/UEFITool), [IFRExtractor RS](https://github.com/LongSoft/IFRExtractor-RS), [CrScreenshotDxe](https://github.com/LongSoft/CrScreenshotDxe), and other UEFI-related things.

I have several years of UEFI development experience at [congatec AG](https://congatec.de) (where I worked as Software Engineer BIOS), followed by 8 and a half years of firmware security and low-level software development at [Apple Inc](https://apple.com) (where I was a part of SEAR Firmware Security team, and was responsible for eficheck, T2 SecureBoot, M-series SecureBoot, BootPolicy, SEPOS virtualization and other smaller things).

If for some reason you are interested in my education and stuff, my [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0009-0007-2919-7926) has it all covered. My patents can be found [here](https://patents.justia.com/inventor/nikolaj-schlej).

I'm currently _funemployed_ for actively treating personal health issues, and do not plan to return to any job duties until those issues are fully resolved.
